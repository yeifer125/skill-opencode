description: Iteratively inspect and polish existing connected Google Slides presentations in Codex using slide thumbnails plus raw Slides edits. Use when a user asks to fix a slide visually, clean up formatting, improve slide quality, make a deck look better, fix alignment, spacing, overlap, overflow, crowding, awkward whitespace, or deck-wide visual consistency in an existing Google Slides deck or shared Slides link, especially when the work should follow a thumbnail -> diagnose -> batch_update -> re-thumbnail verification loop.

# Google Slides Visual Iteration

Use this skill for existing or newly imported Google Slides decks when the user wants visual cleanup, not just content edits.

Prefer the connected Google Slides workflow over generic slide-generation skills when the task is about improving a real Slides deck.
Treat this as the focused formatting workflow: work one slide at a time, and complete the thumbnail -> diagnose -> batch_update -> re-thumbnail loop before moving to the next slide.
Prefer this skill over [google-slides](../google-slides/SKILL.md) when the request is primarily about visual polish on an existing deck rather than content generation or general deck inspection.
Use [visual-change-loop](../google-drive/references/slides/visual-change-loop.md) as the compact reusable version of this workflow when another Slides task changes visible layout or styling.

## Use When

- The user wants to improve how an existing Google Slides deck looks, not just change its copy.
- The request includes phrases like "fix this slide," "make this deck look better," "clean up formatting," "fix overflow," "fix spacing," "fix alignment," or "visual iteration."
- The user shares a connected Google Slides deck or link and wants edits applied directly to that deck.
- The user wants to replace static chart screenshots or placeholder images with charts from a connected source, such as Google Sheets, while preserving the current slide footprint.
- The user wants to update non-text visual elements such as accent bars, arrow shapes, connector strokes, fills, or borders while keeping the slide layout intact.

## Required Tooling

Confirm the runtime exposes the Google Slides actions you need before editing:
- `get_presentation` or `get_presentation_text`
- `get_slide`
- `get_slide_thumbnail`
- `batch_update`

If the user wants to bring in a local `.pptx`, also confirm `import_presentation`.

If a dedicated visual-iteration tool exists in the runtime, use it. Otherwise, emulate the loop with `get_slide_thumbnail` plus direct Google Slides edits.

## Default Approach

1. Clarify scope.
- Determine whether the user wants one slide fixed or the whole presentation.
- If multiple slides need cleanup, still process formatting slide by slide unless a single repeated structural fix is clearly safer.
- Preserve content by default. Do not rewrite copy unless the user asks or layout cannot be fixed any other way.

2. Read structure before editing.
- Use `get_presentation` or `get_presentation_text` to identify slide order, titles, and object IDs.
- Use `get_slide` on the target slide before the first write so you have the current element structure and IDs.
- Before each additional write pass on that same slide, call `get_slide` again so the next `batch_update` uses fresh geometry and current element state rather than stale structure from the prior pass.
- For overflow, wrapping, or neighboring text-box collision work, plan and verify from both sources: the thumbnail for rendered appearance and `get_slide` for live text-box geometry and adjacent object placement.
- For screenshot-to-chart swaps sourced from Google Sheets, read [sheets-chart-replacement](./sheets-chart-replacement.md) before the first write so the replace flow stays grounded in live chart IDs and placeholder geometry.
- For dashboards, scorecards, or metric grids, map the small benchmark or target text boxes separately from the main headline values. Do not assume the smaller target text is part of the same text object as the large value.
- Before declaring a visual element blocked, classify it as a shape, a line or connector, or an image. Then choose the matching raw request family from [batch-update-recipes](./batch-update-recipes.md).
- When positioning a new text box relative to another object, remember that Slides transforms use the text box's upper-left corner, not its center. Compute the target top-left from the desired visual center and the new text box footprint before writing.
- If the user provides or implies a stronger manually polished target slide, treat that target as an explicit alignment and styling reference rather than trying to invent the layout card by card.
- If the current write changes visible text flow, geometry, or styling, follow [visual-change-loop](./visual-change-loop.md) and treat this reference as the slide-local expanded version of that recipe.

3. Start with a thumbnail.
- Call `get_slide_thumbnail` first.
- Fetch the thumbnail for the current slide only. Do not prefetch thumbnails for the rest of the deck before starting the current slide's edit loop.
- Use `LARGE` when spacing, overlap, cropping, or dense layouts are the concern.
- Treat the thumbnail as the primary visual signal for quality. Raw JSON alone is not enough, but the thumbnail alone is also not enough for collision-sensitive text layout work.
- When the tool returns inline image content in `content`, including image bytes, base64 image data, or an image-bearing data wrapper, treat that as analyzable visual input for this workflow and inspect it directly.
- If the thumbnail payload includes image bytes, a data URL, or base64 image content, ingest it directly as if the user had uploaded a screenshot of the slide.
- If `get_slide_thumbnail` succeeds, treat that as the visual verification path for this workflow even if the transcript view looks metadata-shaped. Do not abandon the thumbnail loop just because the runtime shows a thumbnail artifact, URL, or metadata wrapper instead of inline pixels in the message body.
- The response may also include `contentUrl` metadata, but if inline image data is present, inspect that directly instead of downloading the URL or switching to another image-analysis path.
- Do not switch to deck export, PDF rendering, or other fallback rendering paths when the thumbnail tool already succeeded. Only use a fallback path if the thumbnail action itself failed or is unavailable.

4. Diagnose concrete visual problems.
- Before editing a slide, list the specific visible issues back to the user for that slide.
- Do not keep the diagnosis implicit. The user should be able to see what you think is wrong before the first `batch_update` pass.
- Limit the issue list to the 2-4 most important issues on that slide for the current pass.
- Look for text too close to edges or neighboring elements.
- Look for text overflow, clipping, or density that makes the slide feel compressed.
- Look for overlapping text boxes, shapes, charts, and images.
- Look for adjacent text boxes whose copy is colliding, wrapping into the neighboring lane, or reading like one crowded block instead of two separate elements.
- Look for misaligned images, cards, icons, and text blocks.
- Look for grouped boxes, cards, or sections whose header text, body starts, icons, or internal padding do not sit on the same visual plane.
- Look for stale accent-bar colors, arrow directions, border strokes, connector lines, or small benchmark text that lag behind the main headline text.
- Look for inconsistent emphasis such as one label or bullet line being bolded differently from its siblings without intent.
- Look for uneven alignment, broken grid structure, inconsistent spacing, off-center titles, awkward margins, and clipped elements.
- Look for image distortion, poor crops, weak hierarchy, and slides that feel heavier on one side without intent.
- Look for visual regressions introduced by the previous pass before adding more polish.
- Prioritize legibility and collisions first, then alignment/spacing, then aesthetic polish.

5. Make one coherent edit pass.
- Use `batch_update` to fix the current issue cluster for that slide, not just a tiny nudge that leaves the main problems untouched.
- Be aggressive enough to materially improve the slide in each pass. Do not make timid edits that technically move elements but leave the slide still looking broken.
- Batch related fixes together when they affect the same slide structure, such as overflow plus alignment plus inconsistent spacing in one column or card set.
- Prefer moving, resizing, reflowing, redistributing, or re-aligning existing elements over rewriting the slide.
- When adjacent text boxes collide, treat them as one geometry problem. Resize, reposition, or redistribute both boxes together before shrinking text or editing only one of them.
- For small labels, benchmark values, or captions, prefer reusing an existing text box when possible. If you must create a new one, keep its footprint tight to the intended line of text rather than dropping the text into a large placeholder box.
- When the target element is a screenshot placeholder for a chart, treat delete-and-replace as the default move: preserve the existing footprint, insert the source chart, and remove obsolete chart-area text when it is clearly placeholder copy.
- For metric cards, summary strips, or scorecard rows, treat the main value, target value, delta text, arrow, and accent bar as one local edit cluster. Do not stop after changing only the visible headline text if nearby target text or non-text styling is now stale.
- Prefer `updateShapeProperties` for fills and borders on existing shapes, and `updateLineProperties` for connectors or line-based arrows that already exist.
- If an arrow direction is wrong because the existing element is the wrong shape type, or if a shape is too broken to patch safely, delete and recreate it in the same footprint rather than leaving stale visual state behind.
- Do not call a shape-style miss a hard API limitation until you have attempted the matching non-text request family or confirmed that the object is actually an image.
- If multiple boxes or sections are part of a visible group, align their headers, icons, top text baselines, and body starting positions unless the stagger is clearly intentional.
- For repeated card families, normalize the primitives across siblings: matching accent-bar widths, matching arrow scales, matching muted target text treatment, and matching state colors for bars, arrows, and delta labels.
- Do not default to shrinking font size, tightening line spacing, or squishing elements closer together just to make the slide fit.
- If content still does not fit cleanly after a reasonable structural pass, split the content across slides or escalate to [google-slides-template-surgery](../google-slides-template-surgery/SKILL.md) instead of repeatedly compressing the layout.
- Keep each pass narrow enough that the effect is understandable, but strong enough to visibly improve the slide.
- When a fresh revision token is available from the runtime, include `write_control`; otherwise omit it and keep batches small.

6. Verify immediately.
- Call `get_slide_thumbnail` again after every batch update.
- State which issues are now fixed, which issues remain, and whether the pass introduced any new regressions.
- Confirm the targeted issue cluster is actually fixed before moving on.
- Verify that small target or benchmark text changed along with the main headline value when both were in scope.
- Verify that accent bars, arrow shapes, borders, and connector strokes changed visually, not just the text around them.
- Verify that newly placed text labels sit optically centered in their intended lane or container. If the text looks one line low or offset relative to nearby elements, treat that as unfinished geometry.
- Re-read the slide structure after passes that touched text boxes, wrapping, or neighboring text lanes. If the thumbnail and refreshed geometry disagree about whether two boxes are still risky, err on the side of caution and keep editing.
- If a fix introduced a new collision, imbalance, or cramped layout, correct that next instead of blindly continuing.
- If adjacent text boxes still crowd or overlap after a pass, keep working the slide until both boxes have clean separation and readable padding.
- After each verification thumbnail, do a fresh read of the current slide before the next write pass if more edits are needed.

7. Iterate a few times, then stop.
- Run at least 3 full visual loops per slide in this reference workflow.
- Treat those 3 loops as a minimum, not a cap. Do not stop after 1 or 2 passes just because the slide is merely readable again.
- Do not stop after a single pass just because the first verification looks acceptable.
- The second loop must start with a fresh thumbnail review and refreshed slide structure so you can catch residual spacing, alignment, padding, and balance issues that were easy to miss in the first pass.
- The third loop must also start from a fresh thumbnail review and refreshed slide structure. Treat it as a required polish-and-regression pass, not an optional extra.
- The bar for stopping is not "mostly fixed." The bar is that the slide now looks intentional, balanced, and presentation-ready for the current scope.
- After the third verified loop, continue to a fourth loop only if the slide still has meaningful issues.
- Only stop after the third loop if that fresh review finds nothing materially worth changing.
- Stop when further edits are becoming subjective or are not improving the slide.
- Escalate to [google-slides-template-surgery](../google-slides-template-surgery/SKILL.md) when a slide still has structural layout problems after 3-4 verified passes, or when the same issue repeats across multiple slides.

## Few-Shot Pattern

Use this as the default shape of a strong slide-local cleanup:

- Pass 1, functional cleanup:
  fix the obvious breakage first, such as overflow, stale styling, collisions, or clearly wrong geometry.
- Pass 2, structural cleanup:
  align repeated elements onto a cleaner grid, normalize spacing, and separate groups that still feel crowded or uneven after pass 1.
- Pass 3, polish:
  improve hierarchy, whitespace, and visual balance so the slide feels finished rather than merely repaired.

Common middle state after pass 1:
- colors, arrows, bars, or key graphics are now present, but sibling primitives still look uneven
- text hierarchy is better, but labels, targets, or delta rows still sit on different baselines
- the slide is clearly improved over the stale version, but it still looks like a draft repair rather than a finished composition

Do not stop in that middle state. Treat it as the normal trigger for pass 2.

If pass 3 still finds an area that looks slightly off, awkwardly spaced, or visually lopsided, run another pass. Do not stop just because the content is now readable.

## Few-Shot Alignment Example

- Stale metric dashboard:
  the slide has the right objects, but repeated cards still feel uneven because bar heights drift, target labels are too heavy, delta rows sit on different baselines, and same-state colors are inconsistent.
- Better but not done:
  the slide now has the right colors and rough structure, but sibling primitives still do not line up cleanly enough to read as one system.
- Stronger hand-polished target:
  the slide uses one shared hierarchy across cards, consistent primitive sizes, and one state palette per meaning. The cards read as a system instead of eight independent edits.
- What to copy from the stronger target:
  use the target slide's bar width and height treatment, arrow scale, label/value/target/delta text hierarchy, and row spacing as the geometry truth for the stale slide.
- What not to do:
  do not update one card at a time by eye and stop once each card is individually readable. The goal is family-level consistency, not just a slide that is less broken than before.

## Slide-Level Heuristics

Apply these in order:

1. Legibility
- No clipped text.
- No elements touching or nearly touching unless intentionally grouped.
- Keep comfortable padding between text and container edges.
- Text inside a box, card, or shape should not sit uncomfortably close to that container's border. If the padding looks cramped in the thumbnail, treat it as a defect and fix it.

2. Structure
- Align related elements to a shared left edge, center line, or grid.
- Normalize spacing between repeated items.
- Remove accidental overlaps before style refinements.
- When a container or shape is too small for its text, prefer resizing the container or redistributing the layout over tolerating cramped text padding.
- When multiple cards or panels are presented as siblings, keep their header text, icon blocks, and first body lines aligned on consistent horizontal and vertical planes.

3. Balance
- Avoid slides that are top-heavy or left-heavy unless it is a deliberate composition.
- Resize or reposition oversized images/shapes that dominate the slide without helping the message.

4. Consistency
- Keep repeated bullets, labels, captions, and card headings consistent in weight, alignment, and spacing unless the difference is intentional.
- If a row or family of elements should look parallel, treat one-off bolding, indentation, or sizing differences as defects to fix.
- If three or more boxes read as a set, treat mismatched header heights, top padding, or body-start positions as alignment defects even when the text itself is different lengths.

5. Restraint
- Do not churn the whole slide if one local fix is enough.
- Do not invent new decorative elements unless the user explicitly wants a redesign.
- Do not treat compression as polish. A slide that only fits because everything was squeezed tighter is still broken.
- Do not stop after a cosmetic near-fix. If the text is still cramped against a border, still visually crowded, or still obviously misaligned, keep editing.

## Deck-Wide Mode

If the user asks to improve the whole presentation:

Core rule:
- A whole-deck cleanup request still uses one-slide-at-a-time iteration. It does not mean "scan the whole deck first and then start editing."

1. Read the presentation first and make a slide inventory.
- Note the title slide, section dividers, dense slides, image-heavy slides, and obvious outliers.
- Keep that inventory lightweight. Do not present one giant deck-wide issue dump before editing.
- Keep an explicit ordered slide checklist for the requested scope, and do not infer coverage from object ID numbering or from which slides happened to stand out in the first scan.

2. Prioritize the slide order.
- If the user asked for the whole deck, start with slide 1 in the requested scope, finish slide 1, then move to slide 2, then slide 3, and continue in order until the last slide in scope.
- Do not skip ahead to later slides just because they look worse unless the user explicitly asked you to prioritize certain slides.
- Within each slide, address overlap, clipping, unreadable density, and broken crops before moving on to spacing, alignment, title placement, image treatment, and consistency.

3. Finish each slide before moving on.
- For each target slide, run the full thumbnail -> diagnose -> batch_update -> re-thumbnail loop.
- For each target slide, run that loop at least 3 times before marking the slide complete.
- Work strictly sequentially: finish the current slide before starting issue diagnosis for the next slide.
- Do not fetch thumbnails for later slides while the current slide is still in progress unless the user explicitly asked for a separate audit.
- Start each slide with an explicit list of the 2-4 key issues on that slide only.
- Fix that slide before moving to the next one. Do not diagnose the whole rest of the deck in detail while the current slide is still unresolved.
- End each pass with a fixed-vs-remaining issue summary for that slide only.
- Do at least 3 verified loops on that slide before advancing to the next one.
- Do not say a slide is done until you have actually completed the third fresh review loop on that slide.
- Between loops, re-read the current slide structure so follow-up writes use fresh state rather than stale element geometry.
- Mark the current slide done only after the final verification loop confirms it is the next expected slide in the checklist. If deck-wide work ever loses track of coverage, stop and reconcile against the checklist before continuing.
- If the same formatting defect keeps recurring because of shared structure, escalate to [google-slides-template-surgery](../google-slides-template-surgery/SKILL.md) instead of hand-patching every slide forever.

4. Keep a global style memory.
- Reuse the same margin logic, title placement, image sizing style, and spacing rhythm across similar slides.
- If one slide establishes a strong layout pattern, align sibling slides to it unless the content demands a different structure.

5. Report what changed.
- Summarize which slides were updated, what categories of issues were fixed, and any slides that still need human taste decisions.

## Output Conventions

- Before the first edit pass on a slide, show a short issue list for that slide so the user can see what will be fixed.
- In deck-wide mode, narrate progress in strict slide order, for example `slide 1`, then `slide 2`, then `slide 3`, until the last slide in scope.
- Keep deck-wide work slide-scoped in the narration: talk about the current slide's issues, fixes, and remaining defects before moving on to another slide.
- After each pass, separate `fixed`, `remaining`, and `new regressions` clearly instead of giving a vague progress note.
- Do not announce `none that require another pass` until the third slide-local loop is complete.
- Keep the issue list concrete and visual, for example `text overflow in right card`, `image misaligned with left column`, or `middle bullet line is bolded inconsistently`.
- Do not open with a broad deck-wide cluster like `slides 3, 4, 7, 8, and 10 all have...` unless the user asked for an audit instead of an iteration workflow.
- Do not narrate a future-slide plan like `I am fetching the rest of the deck now` before finishing the current slide.

## Editing Guidance For Raw Slides Requests

The Slides connector exposes raw `batch_update` requests. That means:
- Always inspect the current slide before editing.
- Keep the tool loop local to the current slide: one slide thumbnail in, one slide edit pass, one verification thumbnail out.
- Use object IDs from the live slide state, not guessed IDs.
- Distinguish shape styling from line styling before writing. A colored arrow may be a filled shape, a line with arrowheads, or an image; the request family must match the element type.
- For fills and borders, start with `updateShapeProperties`. For connector or line strokes, start with `updateLineProperties`.
- When replacing a screenshot placeholder with a source chart, reuse the current image geometry as the starting insertion footprint instead of inventing a new layout.
- If nearby text updated but the accent bar, arrow, or border stayed stale, treat the slide as incomplete rather than “mostly done.”
- Prefer reversible, geometric edits first: transform, size, alignment, deletion only when clearly safe.
- If a text box is too dense, try resizing, redistributing, or reflowing the slide before shortening the text.
- If the only apparent fix is to compress all the content tighter, stop and reconsider the layout pattern instead of blindly applying that edit.

## Failure Policy

- If the thumbnail action is unavailable, say that visual verification is blocked and fall back to structural cleanup only if the user still wants that.
- If the thumbnail action succeeded, do not claim that visual verification is blocked just because the response was wrapped as metadata or a separate artifact in the runtime transcript.
- If the runtime lacks the Slides edit action, stop and say the deck can be diagnosed but not corrected from Codex.
- If repeated passes do not improve the slide, stop and explain what remains subjective or structurally constrained.
